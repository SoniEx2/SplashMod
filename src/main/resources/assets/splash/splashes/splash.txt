# To make a splash starting with a #, add a % before it, like so:
%#SplashMod
# (Shows up as "#SplashMod" on the log)

# If the first line starts with #!, followed by a number n, followed by ":", followed by n characters,
# it'll be treated as a logid flag. For usage example see BuildCraft|Core.txt
# TODO: rewrite it to be more intuitive
